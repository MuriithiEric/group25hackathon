In this github repo, we as group number 25 solved a myriad of coding challenges using python :smile:


# Problem Statement

We were tasked to come up with creative, simple programs that revolve around calculations using hard coded as well as user inputed values, in addition to implementing well though out conditional statements where we dabbled and understood how to structure data correctly as well as algorithms. :sunglasses:


# Proof of concept

As a group, before we agreed on a specific file to submit, we internally reviewed each other's work and the thought process behind each other's programs. For example, this was a possible solution to the task we had for Day 2 Task 2 that took user inputs and determines what career the user should study. We did this for all challenges.

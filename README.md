In this github repo, we as group number 25 solved a myriad of coding challenges using python :smile:

 
# Problem Statement :pencil2:

We were tasked to come up with creative, simple programs that revolve around calculations using hard coded as well as user inputed values, in addition to implementing well though out conditional statements where we dabbled and understood how to structure data correctly as well as algorithms. :sunglasses:


# Proof of concept :bulb:

As a group, before we agreed on a specific file to submit, we internally reviewed each other's work and the thought process behind each other's programs. For example, this was a possible solution to the task we had for Day 2 Task 2 that took user inputs and determines what career the user should study. We did this for all challenges.

# Business Value :money_with_wings:

It is when we create these kinds of programs that we realize the efficiency that computers give us which is unmatched. Implementing programs like these written in python are more efficient than those prepared by human beings because human beings are prone to error, especially in instances where many calculations are being done over a short period of time. Therefore, when a program is fed correct data for example when making a calculation, you will always be sure that you will get the desired result. This means when money is involved, users and administrators can rest assured knowing that the program will always give them the correct result and that no money will be lost to human error. :white_check_mark:
